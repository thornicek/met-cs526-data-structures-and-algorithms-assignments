# Met CS 526 Data Structures and Algorithms Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments I did for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. This course covers various data structures, that are used to solve computational problems. In this course algorithms are created, decomposed and expressed pseudocode. The running time of various algorithms and their computational complexity are analyzed.
The assignments consist of a written parts, which can be found in a docx or a pdf file, where I answer various questions about data structures and algorithms.
The second part of the assignments are the Java files, where I implemented different data structures and algorithms in Java.
