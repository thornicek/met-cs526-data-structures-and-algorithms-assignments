# CS526 Assignment 5 Tomas Hornicek

For the first part of my assignment 5 the questions and answers reside in the file "Hw5_P1_P6.docx".

My second part of the assignment is implemented in the file: tHornicek_hw5/Hw5_P7.java. In this part of assignment, I got a chance to compare and observe how running times of sorting algorithms grow, as the input size grows. For this assignment I used elpased time as an approximation. For this assignment I have used and compared the following 4 sorting algorithms: insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and heap sort. The conclusion and graph to this part of the assignment can be found at the end of the file "Hw5_P1_P6.docx".
