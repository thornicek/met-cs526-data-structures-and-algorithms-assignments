# CS526 Assignment 3 Tomas Hornicek

For the first part of my assignment 3 the questions and answers reside in the file "Hw3_p1_p6.pdf". 

For my second part of assignment 3, I have created a Java class in the location: src/nodeTrees/Hw3_p7.java. For part 2 I wrote a makeBinaryTree method, which receives an array of integers with size n=2^k - 1, l<=1. The integers in the array are sorted in non-decreasing order. After the method builds a "complete" binary search tree that contains all integers in the array and prints it on the screen. The size and height of the tree is also printed. This method is recursive and uses the already provided IntBST class.
